    <p>The United States has 5% of the world’s population, and 25%
    of the world’s prisoners.</p>

    <p><em>This needs to be broken up or re-written to fit or roll out differently</em></p>
    <p>Despite efforts to increase public safety, America faces an incarceration epidemic; our prison population has grown 350% since 1980. Many U.S. constituents have blind trust in the functionality of our criminal justice system. In reality, its current standing is destructive to the progress of our great nation.</p>
  
    <p>Common sense reform and a cultural awakening to societal and racial inequities are necessary. It starts with a realization: injustice for one is injustice for all.</p>
